    description: "In the fall of 2017, Andover High School implemented a new block schedule known as 7+H. With 8 days, 7 classes, and 1 enrichment period, students were having difficulty keeping track of their schedule. While there was an Android app, few people knew about it and most students were iOS users. Many students ended up taking screenshots of their schedule and saving them as their wallpapers. This was a quite ineffective method – in order to fit the enter 8-day cyle on the screen, the font size had to be very small, and the hallways were filled with students squinting to look at their next class. Having experienced their struggle, I began working on an iOS app, written in Swift. Students login to the school grades portal and the app, mindful of privacy, only stores the student’s current schedule.",

The program consisted of workshops every other Saturday from September 2017 to April 2018, when it culminated with a business plan competition judged by a panel of real-world venture capitalists. TiE brought in entrepreneurs to speak at these workshops about their experiences and teach us about various aspects of running a startup – research, marketing, finances, prototyping, etc. The cohort split into teams, and my team, recognizing something from our own educational experiences, created a business plan around a software to automate recommendations for teachers that would suggest specific extra help content catered to individual student needs. As CTO of a team of five, I lead the development of an early prototype of the software.",
